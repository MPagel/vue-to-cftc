# Project goal of vue-to-cftc #
This repository enables the field biologist maintaining a CFTC core array receiver to submit data in a format acceptable to our database.<br>
This is achieved by providing the scientist with a series of useful, small programs, a corresponding Microsoft Access Database and instruction for use.

##### System requirements
<ul><li>Windows PC<br>
</li><li>VEMCO VUE<br>
</li><li>Perl<br>
</li><li>Microsoft Access (or potentially LibreOffice Base, but I have not recently tested LO Base)
</li></ul>
 <strong>Please read the <a href='ImportToAccess.txt'>ImportToAccess.txt</a> file for more details</strong><br>

##### File requirements
  <ul><li>Acoustic telemetry __VRL__ (or __.000__) files.</li>
  <li>Corresponding deployments entries in a __CSV__ or __XLS__/__XLSX__.</li>
  <li>The __.bat__ and __.pl__ scripts from this lovely online repository that you are currently viewing. You can obtain these compressed in __.zip__ format by [clicking here![Download Icon](/octicons/gif/cloud-download.gif)](../../archive/master.zip).</li></ul>

##### Basic workflow
This documentation assumes that you've already used VEMCO's VUE to download your data from a receiver.

1. Create a **vdb** with time drift-corrected data.
1. <em>Optional:</em> You may choose to delete tester or beacon tags so only data on fish tags are included.
1. Export all <em>(remaining)</em> detections in **.csv** format.
1. Convert **csv** files using **.bat** and perl (**pl**)script files into CFTC format (PST time).
1. Import detections into MS Access.
1. Import or manually enter deployment records into Access.
1. Check for orphaned detections (detections outside the given deployment windows) using provided Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros.
1. E-mail us the resulting MS Access **.mdb** file.

##### Basic script file usage instructions
 In windows drag desired **.csv** files generated by VUE output on top of one of the three <em>vue-to-cftc<strong>.bat</strong></em>s.<br>
  * vue-to-cftc-plusMS.bat - will include milliseconds in output for all detections, including those with no specified milliseconds value (0ms).
  * vue-to-cftc-noMS.bat - will never include milliseconds, even if present in VUE output. This version is the most compatible with earlier versions of Microsoft Access.
  * vue-to-cftc.bat - will include milliseconds on entries that have milliseconds available from the VUE export. On entries without specified milliseconds (or with exactly 0ms) the output will not include milliseconds. This version is untested with regard to Microsoft Access, but should be roughly as compatible as the plusMS version.
 
**Again, please read the <a href='ImportToAccess.txt'>ImportToAccess.txt</a> file for more details.**

Please first check if your bug has already been reported [here](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue).<br>
Then either create an "issue" [here![Bug Icon](octicons/gif/bug.gif)](../../issues/new?utf8=%E2%9C%93&authenticity_token=blah&title=Bug%3A%20&body=&labels%5B%5D=&labels%5B%5D=bug&milestone_title=) or simply e-mail me.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, rather than this project specifically, [ask GitHub Support](https://github.com/contact) directly.

#####  Make modifications to my source
* On Github[![Fork Project Icon (Mega)](octicons/gif/repo-forked_mega.gif)](../../fork)

  1. Make modifications by creating your own GitHub account and then ["forking"![Fork Project Icon](octicons/gif/repo-forked.gif)](../../fork) this project by clicking that funky looking icon over there![look left](octicons/gif/arrow-left.gif) or maybe up there![look up](octicons/gif/arrow-up.gif). 
  1. You can let me know about updates and fixes you've created by doing what GitHub calls a pull request[![Pull Request Icon](octicons/gif/git-pull-request.gif)](../../compare).
  1. You can check if anyone has requested to update your [fork![Fork Project Icon](octicons/gif/repo-forked.gif)](../../pulls?q=is%3Apr) with THEIR modifications [here![Pull Request Icon](octicons/gif/git-pull-request.gif)](../../pulls?q=is%3Apr). 
  1. For your fork[![Fork Project Icon](octicons/gif/repo-forked.gif)](../../fork) of the project, you can just edit the link![look down](octicons/gif/arrow-down.gif) that says "send me the modifications via e-mail" with [&lt;your@address.com&gt;](<your@address.com>), remembering to include the less than (&lt;) and greater than (&gt;) symbols around your actual address.
  1. Remember if you fork[![Fork Project Icon](octicons/gif/repo-forked.gif)](../../fork) this project, you'll have to go to your settings dialogue[![Settings Icon](octicons/gif/tools.gif)](../../settings) and enable issue tracking by checking![Check Icon](octicons/gif/check.gif) the box:white_small_square: next to "Issues" under "Features".
* Offline/via e-mail[![Email icon (Mega)](octicons/gif/mail-read_mega.gif)](../../issues/new?title=I%27d%20like%20to%20send%20you%20modifications%20to%20your%20feedback%20repo%20over%20email&body=My%20address%20is%3A)

  1. You can choose to "go old school" and [Download![Official Download Icon](octicons/gif/cloud-download.gif)](../../archive/master.zip)
  2. Modify and then 
  3. Send me the modifications via [e-mail![email icon](octicons/gif/mail.gif)](../../issues/new?title=I%27d%20like%20to%20send%20you%20modifications%20to%20your%20feedback%20repo%20over%20email&body=My%20address%20is%3A), which you can do by [telling me your e-mail address![email icon](octicons/gif/mail.gif)](../../issues/new?title=I%27d%20like%20to%20send%20you%20modifications%20to%20your%20feedback%20repo%20over%20email&body=My%20address%20is%3A). The GitHub system will send me an e-mail, then I'll reply to the address you provide, so you'll know where to send the files.

##### Other feedback or questions[![Question Mark Icon (Mega)](octicons/gif/question_mega.gif)](../../issues/new?utf8=%E2%9C%93&authenticity_token=blah&title=Q%3A%20&body=&labels%5B%5D=&labels%5B%5D=question&milestone_title=)
Go ahead and fill out the same form as a bug report[![Comment Icon](octicons/gif/comment.gif)](../../issues/new?utf8=%E2%9C%93&authenticity_token=blah&title=Feedback%3A%20&body=&labels%5B%5D=&labels%5B%5D=feedback&milestone_title=), telling me exactly how awesome these scripts and forms are.
