Documentation adapted from Arnold Amman's Instructions for VUE 1.8/CSV 1.0

SECTION 1 - VUE 2+ (2.1.3 tested):

Using VUE to process and correct clock drift for VR2W/VR3 files:
In Windows Explorer/My Computer
1. Find the VRLs that you wish to process and place them all into the same directory on your computer
   This directory should not have any VRLs that you don't intend to process
2. Create a subdirectory (within the above directory) that will house the drift-corrected data (e.g. "drift" or "DC")
3. In the drift subdirectory, press "Control-L" on your keyboard and copy your directory path ("Control-C")

In VUE
4. Run VUE and then Create a new VUE DB for drift-corrected data
   FILE -> New Database...
   Press "Control-V" to indicate the created subdirectory
   Type a "\" followed by a database name, e.g. "\drift-corrected" and press "Enter"
5. Change the output location for the individual drift-corrected VRLs
   FILE -> "Options" button (not in the drop-down menu) -> "Offload" tab -> "Change" button
   Press "Control-V" "Enter" to select the subdirectory (note: you may have to manually navigate here this time...)
   While you're here: click the "Export" tab within the options. Make sure the bubble for "Default Version" is selected (note, the CSV output for VUE 1 is now also supported)
   Click "OK"
6. Import the non-drift-corrected VRLs and drift correct
   FILE -> "Tools" -> VRL File Editor
   "Control-V" then press the "Backspace" key on your keyboard to navigate "up" one level to the non-drift-corrected data
   Click the top(-left) VRL file, then hold down your shift key, click on the bottom(-right) VRL file - this selects all the VRLs in the directory
   Hit "Enter" or click "OK"
   The "Edit and Import VRL Files" dialogue should pop up. In this every second line is the file that you're importing.
      On these lines, ensure Time Zone is set to UTC (otherwise click on the value there and select "0" then click outside of the box)
   Click "Autocorrect"
   Click "Import" (your response for the radio button dialogue doesn't matter, as the database is empty)
   Click "OK" when appropriate
7. Check and Export your Detections
   DETECTIONS tab
   Delete your tester tags from the Transmitters section in the left pane (right click, select delete or just press the "delete" key on your keyboard)
   Click back to "All Detections" or create an appropriate filtered subset in the left pane
   Click the export (red arrow pointing right) button -> Export CSV
   Change "Sensor format" to "Raw sensor values"
   "Change" the Output File at the top. "Control-V" 
   "\" followed by an output file name, e.g. filtered-drift-corrected or all-DCd. Make sure there are no spaces in the file name.
   Click "Save" or Press "Enter"
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 - PERL/MS-DOS:

1. Perl installation check prior to first use
   To get to a DOS Command Prompt aka "cmd.exe" in the instructions to follow
      Windows XP/Vista: Start->Run Type "cmd.exe"<enter>
      Windows 7/8/8.1/10: Press the Windows Key, type "cmd", click on the entry

   A) Choose a Perl installation online (e.g. Strawberry Perl, ActiveState Perl, both available as external links from http://www.perl.org/get.html), download and install it according to the relevant instructions
   B) Recommended: Check and/or set your Windows %Path% environment variable to look for the Perl program directory
      Note: you can skip this step if you adjust the EX environmental variable within ConvertVUE2forCFTC.bat as indicated
      From cmd.exe type "echo %PATH%"<enter>
      If the %PATH% output doesn't include a perl bin directory (e.g. D:\Programs\strawberry\perl\bin), you'll need to add it to your Environment variables
         If you wish to add capability to run VUE-to-CFTC for just a single login account on your computer
            From cmd.exe type '"C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe" sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables' (include "s, but not 's)
            In the top group (User variables for <username>), Edit "Path" or click "New..." if "Path" not present.
               Variable name will be "Path", Variable value e.g. "D:\Programs\strawberry\perl\bin" (see *)
         If you wish to add capability to run VUE-to-CFTC for all users on your computer
            From cmd.exe type
               Windows 7-10: "control sysdm.cpl,,3"<enter>
               - OR -
               Any Windows: "rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL sysdm.cpl,,3"<enter>
            Type a username/password for a user with ADMINISTRATOR level access if prompted
            Click "Environment Variables"
            In the System variables (bottom) section, Edit "Path" or click "New..." if "Path" not present
               Variable name will be "Path", Variable value e.g. "D:\Programs\strawberry\perl\bin" (see *)
            Skip C; Resume with D
* If there are other values present, please seperate existing entries from this entry with a ";"
     e.g. "D:\Program\strawberry\perl\bin;C:\windows;C:\windows\system32"

   C) Explicitly specify perl paths every time you run perl or a perl script (not recommended, use B instead)
      Type e.g. "D:\Programs\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe" instead of simply "perl" in any of the following commands. You will also need to edit ConvertVUE2forCFTC.bat
      File edits required (in a plain-text editor, e.g. Notepad) prior to the first use:
         Change the 2nd line of the .bat file (the "SET EX=" line) to reflect your Perl executable file's path. 
   
   D) This script needs to have a Perl modules Date::Calc, Data::Types and Carp installed on the machine to work as intended using Perl.
      To install these and other Perl modules (once Perl itself is installed):
         Run CPAN (requires an active internet connection) by either
            Going to your relevant start menu item e.g. \Strawberry Perl (64-bit)\Tools from your Start Menu->Programs
            - OR - 
            on "cmd.exe" type "perl -MCPAN -e shell"<Enter>
         Within CPAN type "install Date::Calc Data::Types Carp"<Enter>
            Feel free to tag other modules like cpanm on to the end of the preceeding
         Type "exit"<enter>; if the window doesn't close, type "exit"<enter> again

2. Use Perl script (after your first use of the program, this is the only step needed!)
   In windows select the desired CSV files to convert en masse, drag and drop them onto the icon for the .bat file
      This will process all CSV files at once, so feel free to select multiple files prior to dropping on the .bat.
         The .bat file must be in the same directory as the .pl file
         This script generates a file in the format of "ConvertVUE2forCFTC-output-yyyymmdd_hhmmss.csv" in that directory
            The time stamp refers to the time the script was run, not the timestamp of the input file(s)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 - MSAccess*
*instructions written for MSAccess 2010 - slight modification may be needed for other versions. If unable to perform steps 3-4 due to incompatibility, please send the file generated after step 2, you may use the Orphans queries to perform manual quality-control.

1. Import the generated CSV into the MSAccess DB attached (note: please leave this file as a .mdb. Do not save in the more recent .accdb format).
   Go to "External Data"->"(import & link section) Text File..."
   Input the file path as the data source
      Quick pro tip: hold shift and right click on the file in Explorer and select "copy as path" then paste it into Access's file name field.
   Click "append a copy of the records to the table: Import_Detections" and click "Next" a few times.

2. Import/Enter data into the Import_Deployments table as appropriate to cover all times that you had a deployment.

3. Double-click "mEstablishTableMenu" in the Macros section for the first use on your computer.  Then hit escape or click anywhere.

4. Double-click "mMoveOrphans" in the Macros section.  Follow the prompts.
   If it says you have a lot of Orphans, you'll probably want to either look at your Deployment windows or your Detections in detail.
   The final step of this macro allows you to choose to Delete the Orphaned detections from the original table
      If you cancel the last step, the net effect will be to COPY, rather than MOVE, the affected detections to the DetectOrphans table.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Then send the access file to us for upload to the main database.

Use a new copy of the access database each time.  Alternatively, you can clear/delete the tables, which can be regenerated by clicking the relevant qCreate query. If you had a lot of data that you purged, goto File->Compact and Repair, otherwise the database will take up a lot of disk space.
