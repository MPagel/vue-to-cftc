SECTION 1 - Using VUE to process and correct clock drift for VR2W/VR3 files
   VUE 2+ (2.1.3 & 2.2.0 tested)

In Windows Explorer a.k.a. My Computer
1. Find the VRLs that you wish to process and place them all into the same directory on your computer.
   This directory should not have any VRLs that you don't intend to process.
2. Create a subdirectory (within the above directory) that will house the drift-corrected data (e.g. "drift" or "DC").
3. In the drift subdirectory, go to the address bar of your windows explorer window* and copy your directory path <Ctrl+C>.
   You can navigate to your Windows Explorer address bar by pressing <Alt+D> on your keyboard
   In Windows 8 or later, you can alternatively use <Ctrl+L> (which is incidentally what Macs and Linux support).

In VUE
4. Run VUE and then Create a new VUE DB for drift-corrected data.
   Click on FILE -> New Database...
   Press <Ctrl+V> to indicate the created subdirectory.
   Type a "\" followed by a database name, e.g. "\drift-corrected"
   Press <Enter> or click "Open".
5. Change the output location for the individual drift-corrected VRLs.
   Click on FILE -> "Options" button (not in the drop-down menu) -> "Offload" tab -> "Change" button.
   Press <Ctrl+V> <Enter> to select the subdirectory if possible.
      Note: you may have to manually navigate here, pending a VEMCO update to VUE.)
   While you're in the VUE Options, adjust the CSV export options as desired
      Click the "Export" tab within the options. Please either
         Select "Default format" .
            - OR - 
         Select "Custom"
         Select "Default" column names in the dropdown menu within the Custom Configuration section
         Check the checkboxes next to "no trailing commas" and "Millisecond time precision
            - OR -
         (NOT recommended) Select "Version 1.0 format"
   Click "OK".
6. Import the non-drift-corrected VRLs and drift correct.
   Click on FILE -> Tools -> VRL File Editor
      Click on the address bar (or <Alt+D> / <Ctrl+L>)
      <Ctrl+V> to paste the previously copied directory
      Navigate "up" one directory level to the non drift-corrected data
         Click in the main panel of the navigation window and press the <Backspace> key
            - OR -
         Click away from the navigation bar and then back onto the desired directory (on the navigation bar)
      Click to highlight the top(-left) VRL file
      Holding down your <Shift> key, click on the bottom(-right) VRL file - this selects all the VRLs in the directory.
      Hit <Enter> or click "OK".
   The "Edit and Import VRL Files" dialogue should pop up. In this every second line is the file that you're importing.
      On these lines, ensure Time Zone is set to UTC (otherwise click on the value present, select "0", then click outside of the box).
   Click "Autocorrect".
   If any of the dates displayed are not reasonable (e.g. a year of 1969 or far into the future) the receiver clock is unreliable.
      Please do NOT drift correct files with invalid receiver clocks.
      Undo the corrections applied to the lines corresponding to the problematic downloads.
   Click "Import" (your response for the radio button dialogue doesn't matter, as the database is empty).
   Click "OK" when appropriate.
7. Check and Export your Detections.
   Click on the DETECTIONS tab.
   Delete any known tester, beacon or range tags from the Transmitters section in the left pane
      Right click on the transmitter ID, select delete
         - OR -
      Highlight the transmitter ID and press the <Delete> key on your keyboard
   Click back to "All Detections" or create an appropriate filtered subset in the left pane.
   Click the export (red arrow pointing right) button -> Export CSV.
   Change "Sensor format" to "Raw sensor values".
   "Change" the Output File at the top. <Ctrl+V> .
   "\" followed by an output file name, e.g. filtered-drift-corrected.csv or all-DCd.csv. Make sure there are no spaces in the file name.
   Click "Save" or Press <Enter>.

SECTION 2 - PERL/MS-DOS

0. DOS background
   If the instructions to follow call for you to get to a DOS Command Prompt or "cmd.exe"
      Windows XP/Vista: Start->Run Type "cmd.exe"<Enter>.
      Windows 7/8/8.1/10: Press the <Windows> (icon) Key, type "cmd", click on the entry.
   To move your cursor within the Command Prompt window, the mouse won't work as you intend.
      Instead, use the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard.
   To paste from the clipboard into the Command Prompt window, you cannot use <Ctrl+V>
      Instead right click your mouse and select "Paste"
   To copy to the clipboard from the Command Prompt, you cannot use <Ctrl+C> or <Ctrl+X>. Instead
      Right click and select "Mark"
      Highlight the text
         Note: If you wish to copy multiple lines, this selection marks a rectangle on the screen
               Start all the way to the left side of the top line that you want and drag through the very end of the second line.
      Hit <Enter> to copy the highlighted text to the clipboard

1. Perl installation check: prior to first use only

   A) Choose a Perl installation online from the external links available on http://www.perl.org/get.html
      Strawberry Perl
       - OR -
      ActiveState Perl
      Download and install your selection according to the relevant instructions.

   B) Check and/or set your Windows PATH and PERL5LIB environment variables to look for Perl directories.
      To allow you to run VUE-to-CFTC for a single login account on your computer
         From "cmd.exe" type '"C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe" sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables' (include "s, but not 's).
         In the top group (User variables for <username>), Edit "Path" or click "New..." if "Path" not present.
            Variable name will be "PATH", Variable value e.g. "C:\strawberry\perl\bin" (WARNING see *).
      If you wish to add capability to run VUE-to-CFTC for all users on your computer and have the appropriate administrator access
         From cmd.exe type
            Windows 7-10: "control sysdm.cpl,,3"<Enter>.
            - OR -
            Any Windows: "rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL sysdm.cpl,,3"<Enter>.
         Type a username/password for a user with ADMINISTRATOR level access if prompted.
         Click "Environment Variables".
         In the System variables (bottom) section, Edit "Path" or click "New..." if "Path" not present.
            Variable name will be "PATH", Variable value e.g. "C:\strawberry\perl\bin" (WARNING see *).
      Create a new variable named PERL5LIB with value e.g. "C:\strawberry\perl\lib" using the same method as described for PATH
      Click "OK" to save the changes to the relevant environment variables

* WARNING: Erasing existing environment variable values may lead to significant issues with other programs installed on your computer!
   If there are other values present for an environment variable, please separate existing entries from this entry with a ";".
   e.g. "C:\strawberry\perl\bin;C:\windows;C:\windows\system32" if the old value was "C:\windows;C:\windows\system32"

   C) This script requires Perl modules Date::Calc, Data::Types and Carp installed on the machine to work as intended.
      To install these and other Perl modules or libraries to an existing Perl installation
         Run CPAN (requires an active internet connection) by either
            going to your relevant start menu item e.g. \Strawberry Perl (64-bit)\Tools\CPAN Client from your Start Menu->Programs.
            - OR - 
            on "cmd.exe" type "perl -MCPAN -e shell"<Enter>.
         Within CPAN type "install Date::Calc Data::Types Carp"<Enter>.
            Feel free to tag other modules (e.g. App::cpanminus for cpanm) on to the end of the preceding line.
         Type "exit"<Enter>; if the window doesn't close, type "exit"<Enter> again.

2. Use Perl script
   Note: after your first use of the program, this is the only DOS/Perl step needed and will only require you to drag-and-drop in Windows
      Please select and then drag the desired CSV file(s en masse) generated by VUE on top of one of the three vue-to-cftc BAT files:
         vue-to-cftc-plusMS.bat
            Will include milliseconds in output for all detections, including those with no specified milliseconds value (0ms).
         vue-to-cftc-noMS.bat
            Will never include milliseconds, even if present in VUE output.
            This version is the most compatible with earlier versions of Microsoft Access.
         vue-to-cftc.bat
            Will include milliseconds on entries that have milliseconds available from the VUE export.
            On entries without specified milliseconds (or with exactly 0ms) the output will not include milliseconds.
      These scripts will process all CSV files at once, so feel free to select multiple files prior to dragging and dropping on the BAT.
         The BAT files must be in the same directory as the .pl file.
         This script generates a file in the format of "ConvertVUE2forCFTC-output-yyyymmdd_hhmmss.csv" in that directory.
            The time stamp refers to the time the script was run, not the timestamp of the input file(s).

SECTION 3 - Microsoft Access
   Instructions written for MS Access 2010
   Slight modification may be needed for other versions.
   If unable to perform steps 3-4 due to MS Access version incompatibility
      (Preferred) Please or adapt the Orphans queries to perform manual quality-control in MS Access
          - OR -
      (if the preferred option is infeasible) Send the file generated during SECTION 2 via a method from SECTION 4

1. Import the generated CSV into the MS Access DB attached
   Note: Please leave this file as a MDB. Do not save in the more recent ACCDB format.
   Go to "External Data"->"(import & link section) Text File...".
   Input the file path as the data source.
      Windows tip: hold shift and right click on the file in Explorer, select "copy as path", paste it into MS Access's file name field.
   Click "append a copy of the records to the table: Import_Detections" and click "Next" a few times.

2. Import/Enter data into the Import_Deployments table as appropriate to cover all times that you had a deployment.

3. Double-click "mEstablishTableMenu" in the Macros section for the first use on your computer.  Then hit escape or click anywhere.

4. Double-click "mMoveOrphans" in the Macros section.  Follow the prompts.
   If you have many orphaned detections, you'll probably want to either look at your Deployment windows or your Detections in detail.
   The final step of this macro allows you to choose to Delete the Orphaned detections from the original table.
      If you cancel the last step, the net effect will be to COPY, rather than MOVE, the affected detections to the DetectOrphans table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 4 - Communication with CFTC (plus miscellaneous)

Send the MS Access MDB file processed in SECTION 3 to Matt Pagel
   e-mail: mpagel at UCDavis dot EDU
   Box: mpagel at UCDavis dot EDU
   Google Drive: pagel at CS dot WISC dot EDU for upload to the main database
You may also send VRL files for archival purposes. In the future, we intend to have file transfer capability built into a webpage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 5 - Miscellaneous

Use a new copy of the MS Access MDB file for each field download period.
   - OR -
Clear/Delete the tables between uses
   If you delete the tables, regenerate them by clicking the relevant qCreate query.
   Periodically select "Compact and Repair" from the File menu of MS Access 
      This reduces the size of the database by completely purging deleted tables or entries
