Documentation adapted from Arnold Amman's instructions provided for VUE 1.8/CSV 1.0

SECTION 1 - VUE 2+ (2.1.3 tested):

Using VUE to process and correct clock drift for VR2W/VR3 files:
In Windows Explorer/My Computer
1. Find the VRLs that you wish to process and place them all into the same directory on your computer
   This directory should not have any VRLs that you don't intend to process
2. Create a subdirectory (within the above directory) that will house the drift-corrected data (e.g. "drift" or "DC")
3. In the drift subdirectory, press "Control-L" on your keyboard and copy your directory path ("Control-C")

In VUE
4. Run VUE and then Create a new VUE DB for drift-corrected data
   FILE -> New Database...
   Press "Control-V" to indicate the created subdirectory
   Type a "\" followed by a database name, e.g. "\drift-corrected" and press "Enter"
5. Change the output location for the individual drift-corrected VRLs
   FILE -> "Options" button (not in the drop-down menu) -> "Offload" tab -> "Change" button
   Press "Control-V" "Enter" to select the subdirectory (note: you may have to manually navigate here this time...)
   While you're here: click the "Export" tab within the options. Make sure the bubble for "Default Version" is selected (note, the CSV output for VUE 1 is now also supported)
   Click "OK"
6. Import the non-drift-corrected VRLs and drift correct
   FILE -> "Tools" -> VRL File Editor
   "Control-V" then press the "Backspace" key on your keyboard to navigate "up" one level to the non-drift-corrected data
   Click the top(-left) VRL file, then hold down your shift key, click on the bottom(-right) VRL file - this selects all the VRLs in the directory
   Hit "Enter" or click "OK"
   The "Edit and Import VRL Files" dialogue should pop up. In this every second line is the file that you're importing.
      On these lines, ensure Time Zone is set to UTC (otherwise click on the value there and select "0" then click outside of the box)
   Click "Autocorrect"
   Click "Import" (your response for the radio button dialogue doesn't matter, as the database is empty)
   Click "OK" when appropriate
7. Check and Export your Detections
   DETECTIONS tab
   Delete your tester tags from the Transmitters section in the left pane (right click, select delete or just press the "delete" key on your keyboard)
   Click back to "All Detections" or create an appropriate filtered subset in the left pane
   Click the export (red arrow pointing right) button -> Export CSV
   Change "Sensor format" to "Raw sensor values"
   "Change" the Output File at the top. "Control-V" 
   "\" followed by an output file name, e.g. filtered-drift-corrected or all-DCd. Make sure there are no spaces in the file name.
   Click "Save" or Press "Enter"
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 - PERL/MS-DOS:

1. Perl installation check prior to first use
   Make sure you have Perl and appropriate modules installed on your computer
   This script needs to have a Perl modules Date::Calc and Carp installed on the machine to work as intended using Perl.
   To install these and other Perl modules (once Perl itself is installed):
   Run "Perl (command line)" (if available) or windows "Command Prompt" and type "ppm" to start the Perl Package Manager.
      If the GUI version of PPM is loaded
         Go to View and select all packages
         Scroll down to the needed module
         Select then right click to mark for install
         Go to the green arrow button on top to begin the install from the web
      If the text-based command-line version of ppm is loaded instead of the GUI, it seems rather useless
         Type "exit" to drop back to the perl command line and then type "install Date::Calc Carp"
            Feel free to tag other modules like cpanm on to the end of the preceeding

2. File edits required (in a plain-text editor, e.g. Notepad) prior to the first use 
   Change the 2nd line of the .bat file (the "SET EX=" line) to reflect your Perl executable file's path. 
   If you don't have Carp in your Perl installation, change croak/carp lines in the .pl file as indicated to die/warn.

3. Select en masse, drag and drop the CSV files onto the icon for the .bat file
   After your first use of the program, this is the only step needed!
   This will process all CSV files at once, so feel free to select multiple files prior to dropping on the .bat.
      The .bat file must be in the same directory as the .pl file
      This script generates a file in the format of "ConvertVUE2forCFTC-output-yyyymmdd_hhmmss.csv" in that directory
         The time stamp refers to the time the script was run, not the timestamp of the input file(s)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 - MSAccess*
*instructions written for MSAccess 2010 - slight modification may be needed for other versions. If unable to perform steps 3-4 due to incompatibility, please send the file generated after step 2, you may use the Orphans queries to perform manual quality-control.

1. Import the generated CSV into the MSAccess DB attached (note: please leave this file as a .mdb. Do not save in the more recent .accdb format).
   Go to "External Data"->"(import & link section) Text File..."
   Input the file path as the data source
      Quick pro tip: hold shift and right click on the file in Explorer and select "copy as path" then paste it into Access's file name field.
   Click "append a copy of the records to the table: Import_Detections" and click "Next" a few times.

2. Import/Enter data into the Import_Deployments table as appropriate to cover all times that you had a deployment.

3. Double-click "mEstablishTableMenu" in the Macros section for the first use on your computer.  Then hit escape or click anywhere.

4. Double-click "mMoveOrphans" in the Macros section.  Follow the prompts.
   If it says you have a lot of Orphans, you'll probably want to either look at your Deployment windows or your Detections in detail.
   The final step of this macro allows you to choose to Delete the Orphaned detections from the original table
      If you cancel the last step, the net effect will be to COPY, rather than MOVE, the affected detections to the DetectOrphans table.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Then send the access file to us for upload to the main database.

Use a new copy of the access database each time.  Alternatively, you can clear/delete the tables, which can be regenerated by clicking the relevant qCreate query. If you had a lot of data that you purged, goto File->Compact and Repair, otherwise the database will take up a lot of disk space.
